          <strong>Manuelenis</strong> is a Colombian-born film director and photographer
          now based in Paris, whose artistic vision is deeply rooted in his diverse
          background in the arts, 90s films, and rock music.

          His aesthetics are defined by a nostalgic and emotive tone, often
          conveying powerful messages that resonate with the heart. Known for
          his wide-ranging portfolio of music videos, Manuelenis seeks to expand
          his creative expression into narrative forms such as documentaries and
          short films, where he can further explore the depth of human emotion
          and storytelling through his visual style
